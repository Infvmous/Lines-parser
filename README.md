# Lines-parser - getting preset string from file, collecting as key value inside single quotes in dictionary, counts the number of found keys: 1 line - 1 file
1. Put text or whatever files to assets folder inside root (or set folder name in app.py)
2. Set line number in def main
3. 'python app.py' to run it
4. As result you'll get data-{current_date}({current_time}).json file
